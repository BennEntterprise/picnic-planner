# I-Build: Picnic Planner App by Kyle Bennett

This document will follow a similar convention to an [i-search](https://gallaudet.edu/student-success/tutorial-center/english-center/citations-and-references/i-search-paper-format-guide/) paper. It is meant to take the form of a narrative where we explain a little about a topic, but then maintain a real-time blog style of writing that cronicles the journey of building a project. 

I was given a [spec README.md](./README.md) for a picnic planning app. It spells out some criteria but since it doesn't cover EVERYTHING I'm going to set some additional constraints for myself. 

## Self-Imposed Constraints

I'm going to impost the following constraints to make sure this coding task can be done in the 4hr time block.

1. No deployment, local builds/runs only. CI/CD gets pretty complex especially if we are getting into high availabilily, TLS certs and whatnot. So this full-stack app should just run locally. I will include some code-quality check on pre-commit that mimic CI/CD Code quality but again, just local for now. (In a real devops inner loopthose checks would be intended to run _pre-push_  but since I'm only pushing once to submit my PR, I'll use pre-commits for now.)
2. No Mobile. Since I'm writing this on a 13in Mac Book Pro I'm going to presume my reviewers are on similar Laptop/Desktop style and so I won't be messing around with CSS for mobile views, nor doing any extreme optimization for low bandwidth networks. We will still employ caching to minimize network requests (as part of the task requirements), but again we aren't considering the footprint of each of those requests.
3. Ideal, Fair Poor Criteria. This is entirely subjective to my own experience as a kid who grew up in the North East of the United States (Castkills of NY, Fredonia NY and Pittsburg PA). If I had additional time I'd love for the user to be able to set their own criteria, either directly setting parameters or by chatting with an LLM about their "ideal day" and letting the LLM set those parameters. Perhaps something like [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index) which I first heard about on [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/show/740/local-ai-models-in-javascript-machine-learning-deep-dive-with-xenova) but that's more indepth than I have time for. For now I'm going to use chance of precipitation and temperature as my rough proxies for Ideal, fair and Poor. My design for this algorithm though will attempt to be open to extension ensuring alterations to the heuristics will be low cost later. 
4. Documentation. I'm going to use this file (i-build.md) to cronicle my building. I'll leave README.md intact (as it has my spec requirements). I will then use a single CONTRIBUTING.md to describe how someone might get this application running locally and expect to contribute to the codebase. I also set myself as default owner in the CODEOWNERS file to leverage Github review mechanics to automatically reviewer. If we had groups we might also add a group to that file (out of scope).
5. Caching. Will likely use Redis to cache forecast information by ZipCode. If not just store it in the databse. I'll likely have this expire after an hour. To help with visualizing on the frontend I think it would be nice to show when data has returned from a cache or a full request to the API but maybe I'll leave that out. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6. Local Development. If this were intended to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster I might advocate a development environment that most mimics production by using tools like [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fmacos%2Farm64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download) or [k3s](https://k3s.io/) on [k3d](https://k3s.io/). However, I'm going to stick with one nodejs/express backend and a single react application that are composed together (with any other resources like redis) with Docker. Design of the express application will try to ensure that should we move to multiple microservices later, we can "lift-and-shift" entire groups of routers/controllers/services to our heart's content. Building separate services instead of a react-app-within-node-app-monolith will put us one partial step closer to a read deployed microservice architecture.


## Setting my local environment

### Overview

My preferred stack (based on comfort, not necessarily the right tool for this task) is Full-Stack Typescript (react and express) with a Postgres persistence layer and a redis cache. I'm going to scaffold all of this not as a monolith, but as monorepo utilizing [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) and likely [turborepo](https://turborepo.com/). Turborepo builds on workspaces by allowing caching npm builds and also enabling some nice workflows when running scripts across multiple project. 

Each project should be able to run on it's own (they are afterall each their own NPM project) however the intendend development flow is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and the docker-compose so I will focus on that flow.

(paused here to go write the beginning of the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document.)
(I've just finished the beginning of the contributing document which outlines the requirements and includes the `install` and `dev` commands. Now let's into building a bunch of scaffolding code.)

### Npm Workspaces and Turbo Repo

#### Set the workspaces
I'm going to set up 2 projects within the `apps` folder, a frontend and backend. 

`npm init -w apps/fr`
`npm init -w apps/be`

This gives me an empty project in those locations each with their own package.json file. I also need to create/update a `.gitignore` to exclude node_modules.

#### Scaffold basic apps in each workspace

I'll need a react app in the fe and an express app in the backend, both should use typescript. 

I opt for the [quickstart guide for vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) using the command `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts` to scaffold a frontend.
